# 🏢 Employee Management System – SQL Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **SQL-based Employee Management System** designed to manage and analyze employee-related data such as departments, job roles, salaries, qualifications, leaves, and payroll.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how relational databases and SQL queries can be used to extract meaningful business insights from HR data.

## 🗂 Database Structure

The project includes the following tables:

* **Employee** – Stores employee details
* **JobDepartment** – Stores department and job role information
* **SalaryBonus** – Stores salary and bonus details
* **Qualification** – Stores employee qualifications
* **Leaves** – Stores leave records
* **Payroll** – Stores payroll transactions

The tables are connected using **Primary Keys and Foreign Keys** to maintain relational integrity.

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

### 1️⃣ Employee Insights

* Total number of unique employees
* Employee distribution across departments
* Top 5 highest-paid employees
* Total company salary expenditure

### 2️⃣ Job Role & Department Analysis

* Number of job roles per department
* Average salary range per department
* Highest-paying job roles
* Total salary allocation per department

### 3️⃣ Qualification & Skills Analysis

* Employees with at least one qualification
* Positions requiring the most qualifications
* Employees with highest qualification count

### 4️⃣ Leave & Absence Analysis

* Year with most leave records
* Average leave patterns by department
* Employees with highest leave count
* Total leave days company-wide
* Leave impact on payroll

### 5️⃣ Payroll & Compensation Analysis

* Total monthly payroll processed
* Average bonus per department
* Departments receiving highest total bonuses

## 📊 Key Insights

* Departments with more employees tend to have higher salary expenditure.
* Certain job roles receive significantly higher salaries and bonuses.
* Some positions require more qualifications and skills.
* Payroll amounts vary due to salary structure and leave deductions.
* Bonus distribution differs across departments.
